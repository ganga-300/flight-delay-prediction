# Decision Log

Every modelling decision is recorded here **before** it is acted on. Each entry states what was
decided, the options considered, the evidence and which data it came from, and whether it was made
before or after any result was seen. A choice that is not in this log should not be in the
project.

Data periods: **train** Jan–Aug 2013, **validation** Sep–Oct 2013, **test** Nov–Dec 2013 (sealed).

Status values: **Fixed** (decided, not to be revisited on results), **Open** (must be decided
before the phase that needs it), **Assumption** (cannot be verified from this dataset; reported as
a limitation).

## Phase 0 — Restart and test-set protection

### D-000 · Disclosure of an earlier iteration
- **Fact:** An earlier iteration of this project (branch `main`, tag `alisha-work-snapshot`,
  commit `d4d5da3`) evaluated models on the Nov–Dec test period several times. That iteration
  also changed XGBoost hyperparameters and removed feature groups after viewing test results.
- **Decision:** None of that iteration's model code, hyperparameters, feature-group choices or
  results is reused. The modelling stage is redeveloped from scratch on branch `ml-restart`.
  Every model, feature and threshold reported is selected without reference to those results.
- **Report wording:** "An earlier iteration of this project evaluated on the Nov–Dec holdout; all
  models and features reported here were re-developed and selected without reference to those
  results."
- **Status:** Fixed. Date: 2026-10-25.

### D-001 · Restart point
- **Decision:** Restart from commit `648b780`, the last commit before the earlier iteration's
  modelling work. It contains data loading, cleaning, the target, the chronological split and the
  feature pipeline. Model, metric and calibration modules are unimplemented stubs.
- **Evidence:** The feature pipeline at `648b780` passes its tests (32 passed, 2 skipped as
  unimplemented). A rebuild with every Nov–Dec row removed from the raw data produces identical
  features: 0 differing cells across all 273,355 Jan–Oct rows × 59 features + target, and an
  identical fitted encoder. So no Nov–Dec value reaches any train or validation feature.
- **Known caveat:** Some feature *design* choices were informed by an EDA over all 12 months
  (`notebooks/02_eda.ipynb`). These are re-checked on train data in Phase 2 (see D-101).
- **Status:** Fixed. Date: 2026-10-25.

### D-002 · Sealed test holdout
- **Decision:** All development (EDA, features, training, selection) uses a Jan–Oct file only.
  The Nov–Dec rows are read **once**, by the final test evaluation after the model is frozen.
- **Mechanism:**
  - `scripts/seal_holdout.py` copies every Jan–Oct line of the full file byte-for-byte into
    `data/interim/flights_dev.csv`. It reads only each line's `month` field; no Nov–Dec delay,
    time or label value is parsed.
  - `configs/config.yaml`: `paths.raw` is the dev file and `paths.raw_sealed` the full file.
  - `data.load.load_dev_raw` raises if any row is dated after 2013-10-31.
    `scripts/build_features.py` and the real-data tests load through it.
  - `tests/test_holdout_seal.py` fails if development code references the sealed file or the test
    split, or if the dev data holds a holdout row.
  - The build writes no test split file. The full-year file left by an earlier build was removed.
- **Hashes (SHA-256):**
  - Sealed full file `data/raw/flights.csv` (336,776 rows):
    `8bdc6abbf07ac0cbb1036bc14a787cab3eea616be46c31899d2d8048963b08aa`
  - Dev file `data/interim/flights_dev.csv` (281,373 rows, Jan–Oct):
    `8f206680eda4dc42098dbd4e9a6ec6f89f468afc41cbb913fd528fa4fc0018df`
  - Rows withheld (Nov–Dec): 55,403
- **Check after sealing:** train 217,727 rows (26.37% delayed) and validation 55,628 rows (15.70%),
  identical to the full-year build.
- **Why history features still work at final evaluation:** Rolling history is computed per row from
  outcomes known by end of D−1, so the final run over the full year gives test rows the same
  history a live system would have. D-001 shows this does not change any train/validation value.
- **Status:** Fixed. Date: 2026-10-25.

### D-003 · Random seed
- **Decision:** `seed: 42` in `configs/config.yaml`, used for every stochastic step.
- **Reason:** Reproducibility. The value is arbitrary and is never varied to improve results.
- **Status:** Fixed. Set in the original scaffold (`6bd71a1`), before any result existed.

## Phase 1 — Problem definition

All Phase 1 decisions were made in the original scaffold or feature commits (`6bd71a1`–`648b780`,
22–24 Oct 2026). At that point the metric functions were unimplemented, so no model result could
have been seen.

### D-010 · Target
- **Decision:** `is_delayed = 1` if `arr_delay >= 15` minutes, else 0.
- **Reason:** US BTS on-time convention (a flight is on time if it arrives < 15 min late).
- **Status:** Fixed.

### D-011 · Flights without an arrival-delay value
- **Decision:** Exclude cancelled flights and flights that departed with no arrival record
  (`cancelled_policy: exclude`).
- **Options considered:** `exclude` vs `delayed` (treat any disruption as delayed).
- **Reason:** The model predicts arrival delay *given that the flight operates and arrives*.
  Cancellations and diversions are a different prediction problem (`docs/leakage_policy.md` §1).
- **Status:** Fixed. Scope limitation to state in the report.

### D-012 · Decision time
- **Decision:** End of day D−1 (`decision_time.mode: d_minus_1`). Features for a flight on date D
  may use the published schedule and outcomes known before D.
- **Option considered:** `sched_dep_minus_2h` (recorded in the original config).
- **Reason recorded in the repo:** README suggests D−1 as the default. **Open:** write the
  operational reason (who uses a D−1 prediction, and for what) before the report.
- **Status:** Fixed (choice); reason Open.

### D-013 · Chronological split
- **Decision:** train 2013-01-01–08-31, validation 09-01–10-31, test 11-01–12-31. No shuffling.
- **Origin:** Present in the first commit (`6bd71a1`).
- **Known issue:** Validation has a much lower delay rate (15.7%) than train (26.4%). Thresholds
  and calibration fitted on validation may transfer poorly.
- **Decision on the issue:** Keep the dates. Changing them after the earlier iteration saw test
  results would itself be a test-informed decision. Report the shift as a limitation.
- **Status:** Fixed.

### D-014 · Primary metric
- **Decision:** PR-AUC is primary. ROC-AUC, Brier score, ECE and recall at the operating precision
  are secondary.
- **Reason:** About one flight in four is delayed, so the classes are imbalanced. PR-AUC focuses
  on the positive (delayed) class. README states this from the scaffold onward.
- **Status:** Fixed.

### D-015 · Operating precision target
- **Current value:** `evaluation.operational_precision: 0.60`.
- **Origin:** Scaffold value marked "TODO: justify". No recorded reason.
- **Status:** **Open.** Before Phase 4, record either a cost-based reason (cost of a false alarm vs
  a missed delay) or label it an assumption. It must not be changed based on model results.
